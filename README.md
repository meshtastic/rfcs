# Meshtastic RFC Repository

Welcome to the RFC (Request for Comments) Documentation Repository. This repository is designed to increase community collaboration and ensure transparency throughout the development of Meshtastic. By following a structured approach to proposing, discussing, and implementing new features and changes, we seek to create a cohesive, forward-thinking community.

## Purpose of This Repository

1. **Facilitate Open Communication**: Provide a place for contributors and community members to propose, discuss, and refine new ideas or changes to Meshtastic in an open and inclusive manner.
1. **Ensure Transparency**: Make the decision-making process visible to all stakeholders, allowing for a transparent and democratic approach to Meshtastic development.
1. **Promote Collaboration**: Encourage contributions to leverage the collective expertise and perspectives of our community to drive Meshtastic forward.
1. **Maintain Project Integrity**: Ensure that changes and new features align with Meshtastic's overall goals and values, while preserving integrity and focus.

### When an RFC is _Encouraged_

An RFC is encouraged for any initiative where someone or a group of someones wishes to benefit from the collective wisdom and experience of the Meshtastic community, but are **not subject to the rules below**.

### When an RFC is Not Required

Minor changes that do not broadly impact the project's functionality or user experience may not require an RFC. This includes:

- Bug fixes
- Minor feature changes that do not alter key functionality
- Minor UI/UX adjustments that do not alter the overall design
- Documentation updates

## Timeline

The typical timeline for an RFC process, which is a minimum of 3 weeks, is as follows:

1. **Proposal Submission**: The RFC is submitted to the repository and made available for public comment.
1. **Discussion Period**: A minimum of 2 weeks is allocated for community discussion and feedback. This period may be extended based on the complexity of the RFC or the volume of feedback received.
1. **Revision Period**: (optional) Up to 1 week for the proposer to incorporate feedback and make necessary revisions to the RFC.
1. **Final Decision**: Within 1 week after the revision period or discussion period, a decision will be made regarding the RFC's implementation.

## Decision Making
### Handling Open Questions

If open questions remain as the discussion timeline concludes:

- The RFC proposer, in collaboration with core contributors, will assess whether additional information or revisions are needed to address these questions.
- If consensus cannot be reached within the allotted time, the decision will be escalated to the Meshtastic administrators for review.

### Approval Process

For an RFC to be merged and accepted:

1. **Consensus Among Core Contributors**: There must be approval by _at least_ one core contributor from each project/repository that will be impacted by the RFC during the 1 week **Final Decision** period.
  - **Core Contributor**: A core contributor is someone who
  - At the end of the period, if there are no "Request Changes" from a core contributor the RFC will be accepted/merged.
1. **Changes Requested**: In the case that changes are requested by a core contributor and a consensus cannot be reached, the decision will be escalated to the Meshtastic administrators for a majority rule final vote.
